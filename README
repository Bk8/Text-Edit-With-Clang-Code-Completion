Text Edit with Clang Code Completion

Pretty self-explanatory. Took a bunch of code from a Clang code completion example ( https://gist.github.com/Rip-Rip/758615 ) and the "Custom Completer" example that comes with Qt. Tried to keep it short and sweet by skipping lots of unnecessary bits in the custom completer example.

Qt + Clang = <3


Tested on Debian Wheezy

PREREQUISITES

Of course you need Qt dev packages installed. For libclang, even though the target is Debian Wheezy, you need the Jessie (3.4 at time of writing) build of LLVM/Clang, so put the following line in your /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main

Then:

# apt-get update
# apt-get install -t jessie libclang-3.4-dev llvm-3.4-dev

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
